# [NEW PREPRINT] Unitary rotation of pixellated polychromatic images


Figure: The well-known Lena with $N = 52$ pixels, rotated consecutively by $\theta = \pi/4$. <br> </br>

We address the task to unitarily rotate stacked two-dimensional real matrices of dimension $N$ that resemble color channels of polychromatic pixellated images. Carefully understanding of digital artifacts arising from the discrete and finite nature of the transformation is done. We developed an understanding of the so-called Gibbs-_like_ phenomena in finite two-dimensional signals.<br> </br>
