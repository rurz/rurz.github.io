So, my impressions are no biased by that comparison. Sincerely I have mixed feelings about the show, I have to admit the premise is a little clichy, but the development was very good. The animation also is very good; clean transitions, amazing colors, a little of fanservice, seems right. My feelings go on trial because the angel, not because I don’t believe in angels, or something like, no. Because the angel are a character who clearly lacks the human morals: murder, thief, lie, all this is right because they are a path for a goal. Clearly you can’t sympathize the angel, and when she exhibit some of the misconducts, you may feel an itch in you back head.

That is, music, specifically, classical music is what about the storyline seems to be developed. We have monsters coming from space in rocks, these rocks also gives powers to the humble humanity to fight these monsters… And what power it gave, well, the power to face the outer space visitors as a team of conductor and performer, just as in an orchestra, right. Who are the characters? Well, until the very first episode, only three are known. Takt: A director who thinks that music came first above all things. He gave part of his body and life to empower his partner, the musichart (mussicatto), to fight again the monsters. Destiny: A musichart who have the Beethoven’s Symphony No. 5 embedded in his life as fighter. She takes Takt right arm as a fuel to confront the menace.

In simple terms, powerful creatures of outer space who hate the beautiful melodies humanity have developed across the centuries; powerful creatures with the power of music that creatures have, who have the strength to overpower and defeat it. Characters: Mmm I don’t know really if I am in to it, or not. The director is somewhat disperse, the musichart is like a doll with no emotions, and Anna seems to be like a glue between them. Of course, more character developed with every new episode will clear my doubts, no doubt. Anime art: I think, right now, this show stands up by the exceptional quality of the animation. I mean, we know how the producing studies works, is not a big surprise, although, I have the very impression that we have one of the most beautiful animations in a lot of years. Moreover, it seems that the studies will produce half of the episodes, six by Madhouse and six by Mappa, I guess.
