It was shown [1, pp. ] that in the continuous case $(1)$, the truncation leads a discontinuity over the edges on sharp input function, that is, oscillations that doesn’t increase nor disappear. This is because $N$ is theoretically infinite, ipso facto, we have to stop the sum at some point $\u003c\\infty$ Because equation $(1)$ deals with an analytic periodic function over a symmetric range $[-\\pi, \\pi]$, we want to know, what happen to discrete signals who has odd or even number or entries, how the Gibbs phenomena appear in the discrete version of the Fourier transform, and the subsequent reconstruction.

Discrete signals A discrete signal is understanded as a row vector $\\vec{v} = \\left(v_{n}\\right)_{n\\in I}$. Where the interval $I$ can have odd, or even number of entries $N$.

Conclusions We show that the DFT can be used, as in the same way of the continuous version, as the kernel for reconstruct discrete signal. Furthermore, when we reformulate the system in a symmetric interval, the truncation of the Fourier series at a degree $K \u003c N$ exhibit a phenomena of oscillation called Gibbs phenomena. Nevertheless, one caveat in treat the DFT as a way to reconstruct signals is that the exact reconstruction is possible when the number of terms in the sum is exact the number of points in the input signal, that is $N$.

Introduction Recently I found a new very nice article about dynamical invariants by Kumar et al. [1], that is based on findings by Struckmeier and Riedel [2]. I been involved in the solution of time-dependent systems by means of orthogonal and Lewis-Ermakov invariants [3, 4] and I want to expand the understanding of this mathematical devices on systems who behave like damping phenomena. The methods they provide are interesting because of the generalization over the standard invariants. Here, I provide their use on some basic examples.

The position-position coupling dynamical invariant Starting with Hamiltonian for the position-position coupled harmonic oscillators $$\\hat{H} = \\frac{1}{2}\\sum\\limits_{j=1}^{2}\\left(\\hat{p}_{j}^{2} + \\omega_{j}(t)^{2}\\hat{q}_{j}^{2}\\right) + \\lambda(t)\\hat{q}_{1}\\hat{q}_{2},$$ we see that this simple kind of coupling can lead to interesting phenomena because of the interchange of motion energy in the configuration space, plus the time-dependent coupling that acts as driven for increase or decrease strength coupling. The system is of such simplicity that the solution of the dynamical equations by means of the Hamilton equations is straightforward, we have $$ \\ddot{\\hat{q}_{1}} = -\\omega_{1}(t)^{2}\\hat{q}_{1} - \\lambda(t)\\hat{q}_{2},\\quad \\ddot{\\hat{q}_{2}} = -\\omega_{2}(t)^{2}\\hat{q}_{2} - \\lambda(t)\\hat{q}_{1},$$ where, of course, when $\\lambda(t) = 0$, we have the usual decoupled system.

The position-position coupling is a quadratic function of time $\\lambda(t) = t^{2}$, meaning, their strength increases faster than their own individual frequency of oscillation. If we use this definitions, we arrive to the auxiliary function $f_{t}(t)$ after solving the third-order differential equation with initial conditions $f(0) = 1, \\dot{f}(0) = 0, \\ddot{f}(0) = 0$. The explicit form of the auxiliary function is then $$ f_{2}(t) = \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{2}\\textrm{J}_{-1/4}\\left(\\frac{t^{2}}{2}\\right)\\frac{t}{2},$$ that shows a damping oscillatory behavior, as shown in the figure. It is worth to notice, that in this case of the Hamiltonian, the third-order differential equation for $f_{2}(t)$ is independent of the explicit solution of the movement equation $q_{i}(t)$. Now, if we also solve the movement equation for $q_{i}(t)$, we arrive to a damping oscillatory behavior as well, showing that the mean position of the individual oscillator are in a one and a halfway of the respective configuration space, and as a function of time, their amplitude of oscillation is decreasing after each period. The figure show the damping phenomena.

Conclusions I briefly show the calculations for the dynamical invariants involving a generalization of the standard invariants, namely Lewis-Ermakov for example.
