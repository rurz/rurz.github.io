It was shown [1, pp. ] that in the continuous case $(1)$, the truncation leads a discontinuity over the edges on sharp input function, that is, oscillations that doesn’t increase nor disappear. This is because $N$ is theoretically infinite, ipso facto, we have to stop the sum at some point $\u003c\\infty$ Because equation $(1)$ deals with an analytic periodic function over a symmetric range $[-\\pi, \\pi]$, we want to know, what happen to discrete signals who has odd or even number or entries, how the Gibbs phenomena appear in the discrete version of the Fourier transform, and the subsequent reconstruction.

Conclusions We show that the DFT can be used, as in the same way of the continuous version, as the kernel for reconstruct discrete signal. Furthermore, when we reformulate the system in a symmetric interval, the truncation of the Fourier series at a degree $K \u003c N$ exhibit a phenomena of oscillation called Gibbs phenomena. Nevertheless, one caveat in treat the DFT as a way to reconstruct signals is that the exact reconstruction is possible when the number of terms in the sum is exact the number of points in the input signal, that is $N$.

The position-position coupling is a quadratic function of time $\\lambda(t) = t^{2}$, meaning, their strength increases faster than their own individual frequency of oscillation. If we use this definitions, we arrive to the auxiliary function $f_{t}(t)$ after solving the third-order differential equation with initial conditions $f(0) = 1, \\dot{f}(0) = 0, \\ddot{f}(0) = 0$. The explicit form of the auxiliary function is then $$ f_{2}(t) = \\Gamma\\left(\\frac{3}{4}\\right)^{2}\\textrm{J}_{-1/4}\\left(\\frac{t^{2}}{2}\\right)\\frac{t}{2},$$ that shows a damping oscillatory behavior, as shown in the figure. It is worth to notice, that in this case of the Hamiltonian, the third-order differential equation for $f_{2}(t)$ is independent of the explicit solution of the movement equation $q_{i}(t)$. Now, if we also solve the movement equation for $q_{i}(t)$, we arrive to a damping oscillatory behavior as well, showing that the mean position of the individual oscillator are in a one and a halfway of the respective configuration space, and as a function of time, their amplitude of oscillation is decreasing after each period.
