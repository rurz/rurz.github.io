{{< youtube Jk9KM2HWcKE >}}

### What is it? 

It's a new show, adapted from the manga work by [Tsugumi Ohba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsugumi_Ohba), that actually is finished as January 2021. The animation runs in charge of the spun studio of Production I.G, [Signal.MD](https://www.signal-md.co.jp/). The [wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platinum_End) holds a neat description of the show, and some good resources to look at, also you can look the [official website](https://anime-platinumend.com/), although, it is in Japanese. 

### The premise

In a World, there exist a God, who seems to be tired, I don't know, but he is thinking in retirement on 999 days from now; so, the guardian angels are in charge to enroll the new God among the most pitiful humans they can find. 

Mirai Kakehashi is one of those pitiful humans that hate his life, because his life is trash. Killing himself jumping from a tall building seems a nice way to end... but Nasse, the guardian angel who choose him saved in the right moment before he touch the ground.

Wings and almighty arrows are _gifted_ to Mirai, now he can be happy, at last. But this is mere a lock to put he in the status of _god candidate_, along other twelve shameful people like him.

### My views

I have to confess that I never saw _Death Note_, a work that seem to be very similar to Platinum End in their spirit, because they are from the same author. So, my impressions are no biased by that comparison.

Sincerely I have mixed feelings about the show, I have to admit the premise is a little clichy, but the development was very good. The animation also is very good; clean transitions, amazing colors, a little of fanservice, seems right. 

My feelings go on trial because the angel, not because I don't believe in angels, or something like, no. Because the angel are a character who clearly lacks the human morals: murder, thief, lie, all this is right because they are a path for a goal. Clearly you can't sympathize the angel, and when she exhibit some of the misconducts, you may feel an itch in you back head.

### Conclusions

In my very own point of view, base on my preferences. Platinum End looks that a very good anime to follow for the next four month, it seems that the storyline will be very extended, with the characters, the findings, the goals, the own struggles of each individual. You can count with a show that will keep you busy thinking on what the heck is happening.

You can catch the show on Thursdays at noon, https://www.crunchyroll.com/platinum-end
