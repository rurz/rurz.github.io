# Quantum mirror-field interaction: number of modes and position quadrature


## 1. Introduction

Macroscopic interaction between electromagnetic field modes, and mechanical oscillatory modes are revisited

$$\hat{H} = \hat{H}\_{f} + \hat{H}\_{m} + \hat{H}\_{int}$$

$$\hat{H}\_{f} = \omega\_{f} \hat{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}$$

$$\hat{H}\_{m} = \omega\_{m} \hat{b}^{\dagger}\hat{b}$$

$$\hat{H}\_{int} = g \hat{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}\left(\hat{b}^{\dagger} + \hat{b}\right)$$

where $\omega\_{m}\ll\omega\_{f}$ to ensure that the number of photons generated by the non-stationary Casimir effect as a consequence of the Casimir forces  the resonator with moving boundaries is completely negligible.

## 2. Solution

Initial wavefunction is the tensor product of coherent states on each of the subsystems

$$\left|\psi(0)\right> = \left|\alpha\right>\_{f}\otimes\left|\beta\right>\_{m}$$

## 3. Conclusions
