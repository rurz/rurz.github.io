$$\hat{H} = \hat{H}_{f} + \hat{H}_{m} + \hat{H}_{int}$$
$$\hat{H}_{f} = \omega_{f} \hat{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}$$
$$\hat{H}_{m} = \omega_{m} \hat{b}^{\dagger}\hat{b}$$
$$\hat{H}_{int} = g \hat{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}\left(\hat{b}^{\dagger} + \hat{b}\right)$$
where $\omega_{m}\ll\omega_{f}$ to ensure that the number of photons generated by the non-stationary Casimir effect as a consequence of the Casimir forces the resonator with moving boundaries is completely negligible.
2. Solution Initial wavefunction is the tensor product of coherent states on each of the subsystems]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[1 Introduction: Continuous signals It is well known that a well suitable periodic one-dimensional signal (or function) $f(x)$ in $\mathcal{L}^{2}$ can be expanded and encoded in the coefficients of the Fourier series $f_{n}$ [1, pp.]
$$f_{n} = \left(2\pi\right)^{-1/2}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}dx f(x)\exp\left(-\mathrm{i}nx\right),\qquad (1)$$
that are used to reconstruct the original waveform $f(x)$ up to a $N$ degree,
$$f(x) \equiv \left(2\pi\right)^{-1/2}\sum\limits_{n = 0}^{N - 1}f_{n}\exp\left(\mathrm{i}nx\right).\qquad (2)$$
The Gibbs phenomena is assigned to the behavior of the reconstructed signal under a truncation of the sum on $(2)$, at most $K &lt; N$.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[1. Introduction Recently I found a new very nice article about dynamical invariants by Kumar et al. [1], that is based on findings by Struckmeier and Riedel [2]. I been involved in the solution of time-dependent systems by means of orthogonal and Lewis-Ermakov invariants [3, 4] and I want to expand the understanding of this mathematical devices on systems who behave like damping phenomena. The methods they provide are interesting because of the generalization over the standard invariants.]]></description>
