{{< figure src = /posts/anime/images/takt_f01.png title = "Opening art">}}

### What is it? 

Well, it is a new anime in development as a joint venture between [Madhouse](https://www.madhouse.co.jp/) and [Mappa](http://www.mappa.co.jp/mappa_e/index.html) animation studies. That's right, two of the most prolific and relevant animation houses of the late years -- see Attack of Titan and Hunter X Hunter.

Right to say that the fundamental development of the story is doing by Bandai and DeNA. Also it will have a mobile game version.

For more technical information you can view the offical page (https://anime.takt-op.jp/), or the comprehensive information in the Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takt_Op)

### The premise

I think the main character, summarized very well, **IT'S ABOUT MUSIC**. That is, music, specifically, classical music is what about the storyline seems to be developed. We have monsters coming from space in rocks, these rocks also gives powers to the humble humanity to fight these monsters... And what power it gave, well, the power to face the outer space visitors as a team of _conductor_ and _performer_, just as in an orchestra, right.

Who are the characters? Well, until the very first episode, only three are known. 

**Takt**: A director who thinks that music came first above all things. He gave part of his body and life to empower his partner, the musichart (mussicatto), to fight again the monsters.

**Destiny**: A musichart who have the Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 embedded in his life as fighter. She takes Takt right arm as a fuel to confront the menace.

**Anna**: A mysterious, yet cheerful girl who have the goal to take director and musichart to New York for some _adjustments_

### My views

Well, I think it's a really nice show

**Storyline**: Until now, really there is now much to say, just the fundamentals are given. In simple terms, powerful creatures of outer space who hate the beautiful melodies humanity have developed across the centuries; powerful creatures with the power of music that creatures have, who have the strength to overpower and defeat it.

**Characters**: Mmm I don't know really if I am in to it, or not. The director is somewhat disperse, the musichart is like a doll with no emotions, and Anna seems to be like a glue between them. Of course, more character developed with every new episode will clear my doubts, no doubt.

**Anime art**: I think, right now, this show stands up by the exceptional quality of the animation. I mean, we know how the producing studies works, is not a big surprise, although, I have the very impression that we have one of the most beautiful animations in a lot of years. Moreover, it seems that the studies will produce half of the episodes, six by Madhouse and six by Mappa, I guess.
