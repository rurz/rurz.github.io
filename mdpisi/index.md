# Computation Methods on Quantum systems: Special Issue Submission Proposal


<!---{{< figure src = /posts/notices/images/banner.png >}}-->

We invite to submit proposal for the new Special Issue on MDPI's Axioms Journal. 

The scope of the issue is to collect works around the mathematical, logical, and analytical methods of quantum systems. We encourage related research on true quantum systems, and hybrids. The topics of which we expect works are regarded, but not limited to,  

* Solutions on dynamical equations
* Time-dependent and independent  systems 
* Operational approaches to quantum, classical, and hybrid  systems 
* Algebraic structures 
* Group theoretical methods
* Numerical and computational analysis

We encourage to send proposals to the Guest Editors or directly on the website of the special issue: [http://mdpi.com/si/115980](https://mdpi.com/si/115980?fbclid=IwAR3U8CF2IMGcNPwfl-igikg59YRNkdBV-uNjnaUOVVN_TVz1FdQRihVKQPo).

On behalf of the Guest Editors, we are looking to hear from potential contributions.
