# UnitRots: Unitary rotations of two-dimensional fields using the discrete and finite model of the su(2) oscillator.


## Introduction

`UnitRots`is a public repository containing the algorithms to transform (rotate) two-dimensional fields, aka. _pixellated images_. The implementation is done in [Julia language](https://julialang.org/). 

This plain manual aims to describe the functions and outputs of the software source.

{{< admonition note "Theoretical background" false>}}
For a theoretical description of the transformation, go to the references within [Research](/research).
